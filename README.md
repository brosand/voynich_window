# voynich_window
`evaluate_corpus` is the function to look at, it is called an number of times in `main` for the various corpora that we are evaluating. Also note the output of `analysis` and the code inside of `analysis`. These are the spots that are relevant for the analysis and printing of graphs @Zach and @Youssef.
## Note
This project is very much a WIP. Not to be taken as an example of my work for recruiting. We are developing a framework for evaluating the Voynich Manuscript from a new perspective.
